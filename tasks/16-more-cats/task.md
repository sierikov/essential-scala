# More Cats

**Reference**: 4.1.4.1

**Description**:  
Demand for Cat Simulator 1.0 is exploding! For v2 weâ€™re
going to go beyond the domestic cat to model `Tiger`s,
`Lion`s, and `Panther`s in addition to the `Cat`. Define a
trait `Feline` and then define all the different species as
subtypes of `Feline`.

To make things interesting, define:

- on `Feline` a `colour` as before;
- on `Feline` a `String` `sound`, which for a cat is `"meow"` and is `"roar"` for all other felines;
- only `Cat` has a favourite food; and
`Lion`s have an `Int` `maneSize`.

*Optional*: Optimize your solution.
