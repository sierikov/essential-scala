**Reference**: 4.4.4.1

**Description**:  
A traffic light is *red*, *green* or *yellow*.

Translate this description into scala code. Use algebraic data structures.

*Stage 2*: Using *polymorphism* or using *pattern matching* implement a
method called `next` which returns the next `TrafficLight` in the standard `Red`
-> `Green` -> `Yellow` -> `Red` cycle. Do you think it is better to implement
this method *inside* or *outside* the class? If inside, would you use pattern
matching or polymorphism? Why?
