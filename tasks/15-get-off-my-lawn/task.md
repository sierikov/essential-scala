# Get of My Lawn

**Reference**: 3.5.3.2

**Description**:  
In this exercise we’re going to write a simulator of my Dad,
the movie critic. It’s quite simple: any movie directed by
**Clint Eastwood** gets a rating `10.0`, any movie directed
by **John McTiernan** gets a `7.0`, while any other movie
gets a `3.0`. Implement an object called `Dad` with a method
`rate` which accepts a `Film` and returns a `Double`. Use
*pattern matching*.
